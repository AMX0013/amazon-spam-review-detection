# Amazon Spam Review Detection
This repository hosts the Amazon Spam Review Detection project, a machine learning model designed to identify and flag potential spam reviews in Amazon's product review dataset. Our aim is to ensure the authenticity of reviews and maintain trust in the review ecosystem.

A lot of online shopping decisions are influenced by product reviews. Unfortunately, the prevalence of spam reviews can skew product ratings and misguide potential buyers. This project aims to solve this problem by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to detect suspicious reviews automatically.

This model is trained on a diverse dataset, encompassing a wide range of products and review types. By making this code publicly available, we hope to encourage other data scientists to contribute, improve, and expand upon our initial work, potentially applying it to other domains beyond Amazon
